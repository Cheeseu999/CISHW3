# CIS4340 HW3
**Write up for Homework 3**

### Introduction
The purpose of this assignment is to data scrape the Wikipedia page of the SpaceX Falcon 9/Heavy Launches, and create nine small reports using that data. 
This will be done once with Beautiful Soup and once with ScrapeGraphAI in a Python extraction program.
<br>

### Beautiful Soup
For the non-AI web scrapers, there were two options: Beautiful Soup and Scrapy. I decided to go with Beautiful Soup simply because, unlike Scrapy, I had already heard of it before this assignment.

The webscraping portion of the extraction code references this [helpful article](https://www.datahen.com/blog/web-scraping-using-python-beautiful-soup/), which guides on how to use
Beautiful Soup on Wikipedia.
